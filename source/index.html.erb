			<p>I graduated from Princeton in 2006 with a degree in psychology. My advisor, <a href="https://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/todorov/index.php" target="_blank">Alex Todorov</a>, and I published work on how <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/46/17948.abstract" target="_blank">fast cognitive processes can "predict" elections</a>.</p>

			<p>I received a JD from the University of Michigan Law School in 2009. I also taught as a graduate assistant in the Department of Psychology for two years. Over the summers during law school, I worked in public service and at a large tech law firm in Palo Alto.

			<p>After law school, I served on active duty for four years in the Army, in the Office of the General Counsel.</p>

			<p>I was born near Detroit, where my parents were raised. I'm the oldest of 4 kids. We grew up mostly in the Chicago suburbs. I like running, reading, the serial comma, and (before I moved to NYC) homebrewing beer and wine. <em>Infinite Jest</em>, <em>Moby Dick</em>, <em>Lolita</em>, and <em>A Confederacy of Dunces</em> are a few of my favorite books.</p>

		<div class="article" id="interests"><p class="headline text-muted">things of interest</p>
			<p>I'm broadly interested in public service, civics, and law as code. I'm specifically interested in functional and object-oriented programming, web APIs, and building Aptible into a great company to work for.</p>
			<p>I also still love psychology, especially judgments and decisionmaking. If you're curious, I recommend <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html" target="_blank">this book</a> by one of my former professors.</p>
