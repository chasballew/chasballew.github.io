			<p>I graduated from Princeton in 2006 with a degree in psychology. My advisor, <a href="https://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/todorov/index.php" target="_blank">Alex Todorov</a>, and I published work on how <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/46/17948.abstract" target="_blank">fast cognitive processes can "predict" elections</a>.</p>
			
			<p>I received a JD from the University of Michigan Law School in 2009. I also taught as a graduate assistant in the Department of Psychology for two years. During law school, I learned about the legal aspects of startup formation and financing, and made some great friends in one of the <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/finance629/home" target="_blank">best classes ever</a>. During the summers, I worked in <a href="http://www.fd.org" target="_blank">public service</a>, and at a <a href="http://www.wsgr.com" target="_blank">large tech law firm</a> in Palo Alto.</p>
			
			<p>After law school, I took the bar exam and served on active duty for four years in the Army, working in the Office of the General Counsel at the Pentagon.</p>

			<p>I was born near Detroit, where my parents were raised. I'm the oldest of 4 kids: My brother Drake teaches English in Nanjing, China; my brother Galen is a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago; and my sister Vaughn is a student at Loyola University Chicago. We grew up mostly in the Chicago suburbs. I like running, reading, the serial comma, and (before I moved to NYC) homebrewing beer and wine. <em>Infinite Jest</em>, <em>Moby Dick</em>, <em>Lolita</em>, and <em>A Confederacy of Dunces</em> are a few of my favorite books.</p>

			<p>Technology continues to escalate in compleixty disproportiontate to our ability to fully understand and control it. I'm broadly interested in the relationships between security, privacy, and trust; the relationship of anonymity to liberty; the American political system; and civics and public ethics.</p>
			<p>I also still love psychology, especially judgments and decisionmaking. If you're curious, I recommend <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html" target="_blank">this book</a> by one of my former professors.</p>
