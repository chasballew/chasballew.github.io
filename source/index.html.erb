            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Princeton in 2006 with a degree in psychology. My advisor, <a href="https://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/todorov/index.php" target="_blank">Alex Todorov</a>, and I published work on how <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/46/17948.abstract" target="_blank">fast cognitive processes can predict elections</a>.</p>

            <p>I taught as a graduate assistant for two years in the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan, where I graduated from law school in 2009. During law school, I learned about the legal aspects of startup formation and financing, and made some great friends in one of the <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/finance629/home" target="_blank">best classes ever</a>. During the summers, I worked in <a href="http://www.fd.org" target="_blank">public service</a>, and at a <a href="http://www.wsgr.com" target="_blank">large tech law firm</a> in Palo Alto.</p>
            <p>After law school, I served on active duty for four years in the Army, working in the Office of the General Counsel at the Pentagon.</p>
